				<li>New setting under the Replay Folder Monitor node:<br>
				<span class="h">Only pick up "Just Played" new replays</span><br>
					If this is enabled (it is by default), only games that were just
					played will be picked up as new replays.<br> The advantage and
					consequence of this is that if you download replays from others or
					you copy / drop "old" replays into monitored replay folders, they
					will not be picked up and handled as "new replays".<br> This
					extends to everything under the Replay Folder Monitor node:
					renaming new replays, auto-opening them in the Replay Analyzer,
					showing Last Game Info Overlay, Auto backup, playing 'Replay saved'
					voice.

						<li>Archon mode is indicated in the format property with

							display data for the whole team only, these statistics have no
							meaning and cannot be broken down into individual users (as teams
							control one common base / player). These include SQ and Supply
							Capped %. Basically this is the same as turning on the "Teams As
							One" combo box for non-Archon replays. Other charts and metrics

							be "merged" into one by enabling the "Teams As One" combo box

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Time trend tab in Multi-Replay
						Analyzer</span><br> The Time trend tab encapsulates the previous
					Hour and Day tabs, and adds further Session, Date (day of month)
					and Month (month of year) tabs.<br> The <span class="h">Playing
						Session</span> (or simply <span class="h">Session</span>) is a series of
					<span class="h">subsequent</span> plays where the break between
					plays is not greater than a specified limit. This limit is the Max
					Session Break and can be viewed / changed on the Multi-Replay
					Analyzer settings page.<br> The Time trend Session tab
					analyzes your Playing Sessions, and calculates statistics for the
					plays based on their <span class="h">position</span> in their
					Playing Sessions.<br> The value in the "Play # in session"
					column tells which play from each session is included in the row's
					statistics. For example the first row (Play # in session = 1) shows
					you statistics of your first plays from each session (this is when
					you sit down and start to play).<br> You can use this Time
					trend Session statistics to analyze your <span class="h">stamina</span>
					and decide how many practice plays you need before you go serious,
					or after how many plays you should take a break before your
					performance starts to deteriorate.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Timelapse tab in Multi-Replay
						Analyzer</span><br> The Timelapse tab has multiple sub-tabs:
					Session, Year, Month, Week, Day, Play. Each shows general stats
					aggregated for the specified time periods / granularity.<br>
					The Timelapse Session tab lists all your playing sessions, and a
					session stats row shows statistics for all the plays of that
					particular session (contrary to the Time trend Session tab which
					takes one play from each session at the most based on the play's
					position).<br> The final Play tab lists every single play of
					the player.<br> This can be used to view your time
					development, improvement over time.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Numeric columns</span> in Stats tables of
					the Multi-Replay Analyzer are now displayed as <span class="h">progress
						bars</span> making the rows visually comparable.<br> This basically
					turns all numeric columns into <span class="h">vertical bar
						charts</span>; or more than that because the table (and thus the bar
					chart) can be filtered and sorted by any columns.</li>

				<li>Added new columns to Map stats tabs in the Multi-Replay
					Analyzer.<br> New columns include the <span class="h">Map
						size</span> column, which is sorted by the map area (width*height).
					Sorting by this you can check for example how game length relates
					to the map size.
				</li>

				<li>The "Races %" column in the Multi-Replay Analyzer is now
					rendered as a <span class="h">colored bar code</span>.<br>
					Each race has its color (based on SC2 itself: <font color="blue">Blue</font>
					for Protoss, <font color="green">Green</font> for Terran and <font
					color="red">Red</font> for Zerg), and the race distribution is
					visualized with a multi-colored bar making the used races visually
					standing out.
				</li>

				<li>The APM, SPM, SQ, SC % tabs have been grouped into a <span
					class="h">"Metric trend"</span> tab.
				</li>

				<li>Added a new "Multi-Replay Analyze Replays of the Selected
					Row" to the tool bar of all stats table. With this you can launch a
					new Multi-Replay Analyzer to analyze only the replays of the
					selected stats row.</li>

				<li>Scelight External Module API and SDK 1.2.</li>
				<li>Other minor changes and improvements.</li>

			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Multi-Replay Analyzer</span><br> The
					major part of Sc2gears' Multi-replay analysis has been
					reimplemented, and many additional stats and calculations have been
					added (Calendar view, APM-SPM-SQ-SC% range stats; Expansion,
					Result, sum Race and League stats).<br> Detects and displays <span
					class="h">player name changes</span> (including both clan and
					character name changes).<br> The new <span class="h">Calendar
						view</span> shows stats grouped by day in a calendar layout, also uses
					different colors to indicate the total play time on each day (in
					Player details).<br> In any stats table you can select a row
					and <span class="h">list the replays that assemble the stats
						of the selected row</span> (this was a long awaited, missing feature in
					Sc2gears). The result Replay list can also be filtered further with
					the Scelight Replay filter system, and further filtered results can
					also be opened in a new Multi-Replay Analyzer.<br> In the
					Multi-Replay Analyzer you also have the option to view / edit the
					filters that were used to perform the analysis, and you can
					fine-tune the filters to repeat the analysis in a new Multi-Replay
					Analyzer.<br> The Replay Folders page now contains new 2
					buttons to launch a Multi-Replay Analyzer for the selected Replay
					folder, with the attached or custom filters.<br> The Replay
					list page also contains a new button to Multi-Replay Analyze all
					listed replays (using the same source and filters), and a new
					button to Multi-Replay Analyze only the selected replays.</li>
				<li>The general table tool bar (with search and filter) now
					also shows the <span class="h">Selected</span> rows count along
					with the Listed and All rows count.
				</li>
				<li>Improved Replay parser engine to better support custom
					games (games that failed to parse before will most likely work
					now).</li>
				<li>The Replay list column setup dialog now also shows an <span
					class="h">icon</span> column.
				</li>
				<li>Added many new icons.</li>
				<li>Numbers with fraction parts are now displayed with 2
					fraction digit precision (e.g. SPM, Supply-capped %).</li>
				<li>Increased the default/initial size of the application
					dialogs and the launcher window.</li>
				<li>Scelight External Module API and SDK 1.1.</li>

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">External Module API 1.0</span><br> The
					External Module API has reached version 1.0 and is now public. This
					means everyone can now create external modules for Scelight to
					extend its functionalities and capabilities.<br> The External
					Module API exposes advanced engines, components and libraries, the
					very <span class="h">core</span> APIs that are used <span class="h">internally</span>
					to build the UI and features of Scelight, making it possible for
					external modules to create UIs that are <span class="h">consistent</span>
					with Scelight and to <span class="h">deeply integrate</span> into
					Scelight. The Scelight External Module API is more than just an
					interface API: it is a <span class="h">platform</span>.<br>
					This means the power is in your hands, but to utilize this power
					you have get familiar with certain aspects, concepts and interfaces
					of the API (the 1.0 API exposes <span class="h">hundreds</span> of
					interfaces and classes).<br> Main exposed components:
					<ul>
						<li>Application logger.</li>
						<li>Language and locale specific utilities.</li>
						<li>Extended and custom Swing GUI component library.</li>
						<li>Settings. External modules can specify settings and
							integrate into the Settings dialog; take advantage of setting
							dependent and bound components and listen to setting changes.</li>
						<li>Replay parser engine.</li>
						<li>Replay processor engine.</li>
						<li>Basic SC2 Balance Data.</li>
						<li>Name template engine.</li>
						<li>Replay search engine.</li>
						<li>SC2 monitor (current game status, live APM, game status
							change listening).</li>
						<li>Replay folder monitor (new replay listening).</li>
						<li>Sound utilities (background sound player - including MP3
							format).</li>
						<li>General utilities to help implement any kind of code.</li>
					</ul> More will be added / exposed in the future.<br> The External
					Module API library also contains the source code of the interface.
					This means whenever you use the auto-complete feature of modern
					IDEs (like Eclipse) or you move your mouse cursor over different
					parts of your code, the Javadoc of the appropriate entity (e.g. a
					method or interface) will be displayed to you.<br> The
					External Module API is part of the Scelight External Module SDK
					(see below), you can download it from the <a
					href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a>
					page.</li>

				<li><span class="h">Scelight External Module SDK</span><br>
					I have created an SDK (Software Development Kit) to aid the
					development of Scelight External Modules. You can download the
					Scelight External Module SDK from the <a
					href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/downloads">Downloads</a>
					page.<br> The SDK is a <span class="h">complete Eclipse
						project</span> with an Ant build script which can build releases of the
					external module, make deployments, install / inject it into a
					Scelight installation and make project backups.<br> The SDK
					also contains the External Module API library and its Javadoc.<br>
					To get started with the SDK, first download it and extract it, then
					use the File / Import... menu in Eclipse, choose "Existing Projects
					into Workspace" and select the extracted ScelightExtModSDK folder
					which is the Eclipse project root.<br> The External Module SDK
					also contains an example Hello World external module with source
					code.<br> External Module API, SDK and general external module
					development info: <a
					href="https://sites.google.com/site/scelight/external-modules">External
						Modules</a><br> The Javadoc from the External Module API archive
					is also a number one source of information, and it is also
					available online for browsing here: <a
					href="https://scelightop.appspot.com/scelight-ext-mod-api/">Scelight
						External Module API Javadoc</a></li>

				<li>The Components page of the About dialog now lists loaded
					and started external modules too, and a new "Type" column displays
					the type of the components.</li>

							player).</li>
					</ul> The <span class="h">"Is Competitive?"</span> filter now also
					accepts AutoMM games with version less than 2.0 (when there was no
					unranked games and AutoMM games were equal to ladder games).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Last Game info Overlay card
						improvements</span><br> Rearranged columns based on importance and
					to be consistent with the Users tab, also added a new column: <span

				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when contents
					of sub-tabs of the Inspector tab (visible only on Developer skill
					level) of the Replay analyzer were scrolled with the mouse scroll
					wheel.</li>
				<li>The External Module API design and development got a boost

			<b>Changes and new features:</b>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="h">Filters and Replay Search</span><br>
					Powerful filters and advanced Replay Search have finally arrived.
					Predefined replay filters can be <span class="h">attached</span> to
					Replay folders, and when you want to list the contents of a Replay
					folder, the attached filters will be applied <span class="h">automatically</span>.<br>
					You can view/edit the attached Replay filters of a Replay folder by
					selecting the Replay folder and pressing the new "Edit Attached
					Filters" button. This will open the Replay Filters Editor (see
					below).<br> You can also <span class="h">search Replay
						folders</span> by pressing the "Search Replay Folders" button in which
					case a Replay Filters Editor will pop up where you can specify
					custom filters (instead of the attached filters).<br> A new
					"Filters" column indicates the <i>active</i> attached filters count
					for each Replay folder in the table. <i>Active</i> means it is
					enabled and it is valid (contains no errors).<br> The Replay
					list page now has a new <span class="h">"View / Edit Filters
						and Repeat Search"</span> button. This opens a Replay Filters Editor
					where you can view the filters that were applied when replays were
					listed, and you can also modify these filters (<i>tune</i> them)
					and repeat the search on the source Replay folder. Repeating the
					search will list the new results in a new Replay list page.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Replay Filters Editor</span><br> The
					Replay Filters Editor is used to view and edit Replay filters that
					are applied when searching / listing replays of a Replay folder.<br>
					<span class="h">It is table-based, equation-editor-like,
						easy but powerful filters editor.</span> It is easy to quickly add a few
					filters like Map name, Replay date, Version, Region etc.<br>
					It is also possible to build complex queries as it supports <span
					class="h">filter connections</span> like logical AND and logical
					OR, supports <span class="h">parenthesis (grouping of
						filters)</span>, and <span class="h">advanced operators</span> like
					contains, starts with, ends with and <span class="h">MATCHES</span>
					(regular expression matching).<br> The search engine supports
					too many properties to enumerate them all. To easily find and pick
					the ones you're interested in, filter properties (called Filter by)
					are organized into groups (called Filter by Group).<br> There
					are also special groups to filter by player properties. Special
					groups are at your disposal to filter by <span class="h">aggregate
						values</span> of all players of a replay (e.g. weighted average APM of
					all players of a replay); to filter by a property of <span
					class="h">any player</span>, of <span class="h">all players</span>,
					or to specify filters on <span class="h">different players</span>
					or <span class="h">multiple filters on the same player</span>.<br>
					There is also a <span class="h">Filters Structure Preview</span>
					which shows the structure of the filters in a <span class="h">tree-like
						formatted table</span>.<br> Queries like this are easily possible

					<span class="h">loaded</span> from a file.</li>
				<li><span class="h">A new Replay list column: "Played"</span><br>
					This column will show you the replay date in the form of played
					"xxx" ago (<span class="h">relative</span> to the current time).<br>
					Examples: "12m 30s" means 12 minutes and 30 sec ago, "7h 15m" means

				<li>Replay list progress bar now displays Added, Filtered out
					and Errors (renamed from Skipped).</li>
				<li><span class="h">Unfocusable Overlay cards.</span><br>
					Overlay cards are now not focusable by default. This means they do
					not hijack focus when they are displayed, nor do they hijack focus
					when you click on them. Focus remains in SC2 (or in your active
					application).<br> Of course you can still activate / open the
					Overlay config menu by clicking on it, but this also will not
					hijack the focus from SC2 (or your active application).<br>
					This focusable state can be toggled in the config menu of the
					Overlay card.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Moving Overlay cards outside the
						main screen.</span><br> By default Overlay cards cannot be moved
					outside the main screen, and this has not changed. But now the
					Overlay config menu contains a new option: "Allow outside the main
					screen". If you enable this, Scelight will not align the Overlay
					cards anymore, you will be able to position them outside the main
					screen, onto your additional screens if you have a multi-screen
					configuration.</li>
				<li>Fixed a rendering bug that happened sometimes when the
					Events table or the Replay list table were scrolled with the mouse
					scroll wheel.</li>

					Control chart is the successor to the Main Building Control of
					Sc2gears.<br> It visualizes Spawn Larva, Chrono Boost,
					Calldown MULE, Scanner Sweep and Calldown Extra Supply commands,
					and calculates some metrics like the Average Spawning Ratio and
					Average Injection Gap, also broken down to Hatcheries.<br>
					Moving the mouse cursor over any box will show details about the
					related command and clicking on it will jump to the corresponding
					command properly - as with any other chart object on any other
					charts.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Improved Template Engine</span><br>
					New player-specific symbols which can be parameterized by a player
					index which must be outside of a Player Info Block and which insert
					the value only for the specified player.<br> E.g. the symbol <span
					class="h">player1</span> will insert the name of the first player,
					<span class="h">apm1</span> will insert the APM of the first player
					etc. Useful for example if you add yourself to the Favored player
					list, and in 1v1 games you will always be the first player and your
					opponent the second player.<br> The <span class="h">mapWordsX</span>,
					<span class="h">counterX</span> and <span class="h">repCounterX</span>
					symbols are now also parameterized and listed only once.<br>
					Of course these can also be combined with the value range, so for
					example [leagueLong2{1-3}] will return the first 3 letters of the
					2nd player's league (your opponent if you're on the favored list).</li>
				<li><span class="h">New Replay list table columns: APM1,
						APM2, SPM1, SPM2, SQ1, SQ2, L1, L2 to return the corresponding
						value for the 1st and 2nd player only.</span><br> The Replay list
					table can be sorted by these columns properly.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Supports replays of <span class="h">all versions</span>

				<li>Supports replays of <span class="h">all types</span>;

				</li>
				<li>A more advanced <span class="h">name template engine</span>

				</li>
				<li>A more advanced <span class="h">Replay listing</span>
					module with a <span class="h"> rich set of columns</span> to
					customize the replay list tables. You can even create <span
					class="h">new custom columns</span> specified with flexible name
					templates.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">A new charts system</span> which is similar
					to Sc2gears' but is <span class="h">way more powerful</span>: more
					presentation types, granularity in seconds instead of pixels
					(graphs remain immune to zoom and resize), zoom into arbitrary
					small time window, 3-state enlarging for wheel scroll click etc.</li>
				<li>Charts showing <span class="h">precise supply,
						workers, resources</span>, broken down to Army, Economy, Technology,
					categorized by Current, Lost, Killed, In Progress.
				</li>
				<li>A new <span class="h">SPM (Screens / min)</span> metric and
					chart to visualize and measure the <span class="h">multitasking
						skills</span> of players.
				</li>
				<li>The <span class="h">Spending Quotient (SQ)</span> has
					arrived to measure the <span class="h">macro skills</span> of
					players, and not just as a calculated average metric, it has its
					own chart showing the spending skill throughout the entire game,
					optionally broken down to resource types.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Build Orders table</span> showing exact
					build / upgrade activity of all players at once for the whole game.</li>
				<li><span class="h">Scelight Launcher</span> which installs and
					automatically keeps your Scelight always up-to-date without

				<li><span class="h">Module system:</span> Official external
					modules are listed inside Scelight, and they can be installed with
					one click, and have kept auto-updated.</li>
				<li>There is an option to choose your <span class="h">computer
						skill level</span>. Based on this Scelight can hide or simplify some

					options, settings and controls <span class="h">scalable</span>
					based on this.
				</li>
				<li>Even <span class="h">more customization and

		<div class="pbody">
			Development of Scelight&trade; begins.<br> <br> But wait...<br>
			<b>What has led to a successor instead of just updating
				Sc2gears&trade;?</b><br> <br> Many things. To mention the main
			reasons:
			<ul>
				<li>Sc2gears has become <span class="h">big</span>. Too big. I
					never thought I will add so many features to it in the beginning
					and so it was becoming harder and harder to maintain.
				</li>
				<li>Many claimed Sc2gears was <span class="h">difficult
						to use</span>. It has so many features, many didn't understand a lot of
					them.
				</li>
				<li>I have also received <span class="h">complaints</span>
					about the <span class="h">UI design</span> of Sc2gears.
				</li>
				<li>Blizzard finally decided to provide <span class="h">official
						support</span> for parsing replays: they released a low-level open source
					python library called 's2protocol'.
				</li>
				<li>During the last 3-year development and maintenance of
					Sc2gears, I <span class="h">improved</span> a lot and <span
					class="h">gained an enormous experience</span>, I got to know the
					SC2 replay format more and more, and Blizzard included more and
					more information in replays.
				</li>
				<li><span class="h">Java 7 became standard</span>, and it has
					new features which can be put to use.</li>
			</ul>
			Due to the aforementioned improvements, if I were to rewrite
			Sc2gears, I would do many things quite differently. It is much easier
			to do these different things in a fresh new project than to refactor
			an existing huge and complex project. Without refactoring on the
			long-run I would just make my job even worse.<br> No question it
			would've been easier to just update Sc2gears than to create something
			entirely new. But I plan a much longer and more important role for my
			project than to just choose the easier path.<br> <br>
